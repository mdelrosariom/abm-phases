    This creates a matrix with 3 values:
    1 represents mainland, generally the half of it in the left side from top to bottom, given by main
    0 represents the sea 
    2 represents the island, which position in the sea is random, but always is at least 2 squares away (easy to change, look at it!) from the mainland. The 
    size of the island can be modified by the size argument. it needs to be a whole number.
